This device runs the Bitcoin Core software implementation of the Bitcoin protocol and uses it disconnected and offline to generate new-to-the-universe bitcoin keys: private key, and (deducible from private key) public key, aka bitcoin wallet address.

It runs on a standard linux distribution (Rasbian Lite, ie CLI / non-GUI).

It runs on standard hardware:
- Raspberry pi Zero
- Waveshare 2.13inch e-Paper HAT https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.13inch_e-Paper_HAT
- Sandisk micro SD (any will do, I have better results with those optimized to run apps on phones.)

This is an alternative to Coibase for example, that hold the key for you. In that case you donÂ´t own the bitcoin and automatically endorse the risk of their hacking, loss, bankruptcy or government-mandated confiscation.
